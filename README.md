# The Exceptional's Art Recognition Game

## Description

An art recognition game aimed at children ages 14+ to test their knowledge on famous artists! Access the project here: https://henriettacodes.github.io/LFA---P1---Frontend/

This project was created following a brief we were provided as a team, where we had a problem statement to address. A secondary school has faced a problem, where they noticed a lack of engagement in non-STEM subjects, over the last two years and need a solution on how they can overcome this. We were tasked to come up with a solution that places engaging learning as well improved retention of the knowledge at the heart of the learning experience. When looking at a list of subjects taught in secondary schools, as a group we decided art/art history was the one we had the most interest and appreciation for. We put our efforts into creating a solution for the school to overcome their main concerns, in turn increasing student performance in non-STEM subjects.

## Installation & Usage
* Clone the project from the repo here: 
git@github.com:henriettaCodes/LFA---P1---Frontend.git
* Open the project and right click on index.html â†’ Open in live server. This will display the front end of the webpage. Ho

## Technologies 
* git
* GitHub
* Html
* CSS
* Javascript
* Figma
* FigJam
* Coolors

## Process
* Deciding the subject of the game and what the pupil will take from it, ensuring this is reflected on the requirements from the brief.
* Designing the user-flow within the application.
* Choosing the artists who the pupils will be tested against and later to be used to create a JSON file with all the information the quiz is based on.
* Low/Hi-fidelity mockups.
* Creating webpages in HTML/CSS.
* Creation of backend using Express.js, linking it with the front-end.
* Deployment of the project using github pages & render

## Wins & Challenges 
### Wins:
* Executing the game logic which identifies the correct image that the user selects, resulting in a playable and working game.
* Translating the Figma UI into static HTML/CSS web pages. 
* Deployment of our functional game.

### Challenges:
* The backend server needed to be 'spun up' in order to operate as efficiently as we planned. This was remedied by adding a fetch request on the dashboard page to 'wake up' the backend server.

## Future features:
* All the artists in the JSON data useable for the game.
* Logic for working achievements in the game.
* A database enabling working user-profiles, score-system & social leader-board.
* Adaptive UI themes for the application, starting with dark-mode.
* Additional game modes.
* A dashboard for teachers to add further artists + tests. As well as letting them know how the students are performing.
