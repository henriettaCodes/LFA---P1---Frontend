# The Exceptional's Art Recognition Game

## Description

An art recognition game aimed at children ages 14+ to test their knowledge on famous artists! Access the project here: https://henriettacodes.github.io/LFA---P1---Frontend/

This project was created following a brief we were provided as a team, where we had a problem statement to address. A secondary school has faced a problem, where they noticed a lack of engagement in non-STEM subjects, over the last two years and need a solution on how they can overcome this. We were tasked to come up with a solution that places engaging learning as well improved retention of the knowledge at the heart of the learning experience. When looking at a list of subjects taught in secondary schools, as a group we decided art/art history was the one we had the most interest and appreciation for. We put our efforts into creating a solution for the school to overcome their main concerns, in turn increasing student performance in non-STEM subjects.
